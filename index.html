        <p>am sorry, but I did not find font for Russia language, that's why I wrote in English. I was actually too lazy to look and had the site written in about 2 days. The idea came spontaneously and yes it seems that the text can be copied and pasted into a translator. Would it be possible to write a function for it to translate into Russian itself? I think so, but I'm lazy. Well, yes and by the way the site was written to pump up my skills a bit and it seems to have turned out cool ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>

            Bibizyana adina is a rare form of animal that lives in rainforests and on the edge of savannahs. Her sightings on the dostyk plaza, where she mates, make her of particular interest to nature explorers. These little creatures are known for their colourful feathers and unusual habits. They feed on fruit (sweets) and us (Ayat and me), hunting mostly on the ground, although they can fly. No one knows where she lives, she comes from Semey. Legends say that she lives opposite the Hotel Kazakhstan, where exactly we did not find because we were attacked by her.<br>
            Bibizyana adina is known for its colorful feathers, unusual habits, and occasional migrations to different countries. Recently, it was spotted in Egypt and there are reports suggesting it might currently be in London. These migrations add to the intrigue surrounding this rare animal.

            She usually feeds at Paul cafe, where we were able to take a photo before we were attacked by her. Her unusual behaviour and desire for human food make her a particularly curious subject for our research efforts.

                To escape or defend yourself from Adina, you need to offer her food, such as Choco Pie, Doner, or sweets, or give her a bouquet of ranunculus flowers. This will distract her for a while. You can also offer her favorite drink, like tea or coffee, or take her to McDonald's to divert her attention. Additionally, suggesting a fun activity or giving her a small gift (like a certificate to Golden Apple) could help. Engaging her in a light conversation or showing interest in her hobbies might also be effective in keeping her distracted and calm.
